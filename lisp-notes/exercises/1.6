;The normal if statement is evaluated with lazy evaluation.
;Once the predicate is found to be true, the consequent is returned,
;and the alternate is not evaluated.
;
;Thus, when the good-enough? test eventually passes, the sqrt-iter function isn't called.
;
;
;A user-defined if statement means the statement is not a special form.
;Instead, it follows applicative order.
;In this case, the else clause is the sqrt-iter function.
;In applicative order, every argument is fully evaluated before the procedure is called.
;Thus, even once the good-enough? predicate passes,
;the sqrt-iter function will be called since it is an argument in the new-if function.
;Thus it gets called endlessly.
